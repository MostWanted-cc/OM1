title: Build a fresh config file
description: "Config"
---

The config file defines the agent that runs on your machine.
It tells OM1 which modules to load, how the robot should behave, and which modes are available.

To ensure your configuration is valid, follow the format defined [here](https://github.com/OpenMind/OM1/tree/main/config/schema).

OpenMind supports two configuration schemas:

1. Single-Mode Schema

Use this when your robot only needs to run one dedicated mode—for example, a pure conversation agent or a navigation-only setup.
The entire agent is optimized around a single use case.

2. Multi-Mode Schema

Use this when you want the robot to switch between multiple modes at runtime based on user choice or context.
You can configure any subset of the available five modes—just two, or all five, depending on your application.
